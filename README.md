# aos-lab-3

You should have a Makefile which generates 3 binaries: apager (all-at-once), dpager (demand paging), hpager (hybrid). They should accept a single command line argument which is the target program under test. Your loaders should print a message to standard error about every mapping they do for the test program. The message should include the base memory address, file offset (if applicable), and size.
